Ser. No. 60/901,952, SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND CONTEXTUAL LIFE PATTERNS OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR SET OF INDIVIDUALS, filed Feb. 16, 2007.
BACKGROUND
1. Field:
The invention relates to the field of data informatics, and more specifically to systems and methods for analyzing and parsing information relating to information monitored about subjects, including human lifestyle information.
2. Description of the Related Art:
Vast resources have been devoted to the sequencing of the human genetic code and to cataloging the influence of genes and other physiological traits. However, a major component of health and wellness can be attributed to the interactions of subjects with their environment, including their lifestyles. Despite the widely accepted view that lifestyle activities, such as those related to diet, exercise, sleep habits and the like, affect health and wellness, efforts to catalog those effects to date have been limited. A need exists for methods and systems that systematically catalog the effects of various human lifestyles on a wide range of outcomes; that is, a need exists to sequence the human lifestyle. The low cost and ready availability of sensors has reduced costs of collecting data. In addition, improved data integration and processing methods have allowed for use of existing data sources. However, this wealth of data has not yet led to a better overall understanding of the influence of particular lifestyles; instead, the wealth of data has overwhelmed existing systems and methods. A need exists for methods and systems that allow for systematic analysis of lifestyle data.
SUMMARY
The invention may include methods and systems involving assembling data from at least one data source into at least one life bit, assembling the at least one life bit into at least one life byte and analyzing the at least one life byte to determine at least one lifeotype. In one embodiment, each life byte consists of a plurality of life bits, and life bytes are organized into sequences, each of which can be characterized as a life byte sequence. In turn, life byte sequences can be analyzed to identify ones of interest, such as for clinical research, wellness, or the like, such sequences of interest being characterized or expressed as lifeotypes (as described below).
At least one data source rendering a life bit may be a body monitor, such as one that includes one or more sensors.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
Humankind has sequenced the human genetic code, resulting in the identification of sequences of genes that are related to particular conditions, outcomes or the like. Thus, a certain genotype can be associated with outcomes, allowing the prediction of outcomes for individuals or groups that share that genotype. However, despite a wealth of information collected about lifestyles, similar efforts have not been undertaken to sequence data related to the human lifestyle in order to allow the drawing of the same kinds of inferences about individuals or groups that share the same lifestyle. The low cost and ready availability of sensors has reduced costs of collecting data. In addition, improved data integration and processing methods have allowed for use of existing data sources. The availability of this wealth of data creates a unique opportunity for data analytics and data processing, which may be used to analyze and parse the wealth of human lifestyle information. Importantly, methods and systems are disclosed herein for organizing data about lifestyles into meaningful sequences of information, allowing analysis and drawing of inferences about the effects of human lifestyles. Among other advantages, data processing and data analytics, applied to life bits, life bytes, life byte sequences and lifeotypes, may also allow for the creation or identification of new surrogate measures, sensors and vital signs, as well as predictors of certain conditions.
Thus, the concept of a âlifeotypeâ encompasses classifying human state data, or other data concerning a population or sub-population of individuals, into âtypesâ that correspond to certain combinations of traits or aspects of human lifestyle, human status and/or human condition. In embodiments, the concept of a lifeotype may also be applied to other organisms. By analyzing patterns within and across the lifeotypes, one can draw conclusions, make inferences, and make predictions about each type that apply to the members of the type or to groups of individuals of that type. The possible types may be composed of combinations of individual data types which may be measured continuously over time or at discrete intervals.
Referring to FIG. 1, the concept of a lifeotype may be further understood by analogy to bits and bytes of information in the data world. Information may be organized into bits, bits may be organized into bytes, bytes may be organized into sequences, and any of the foregoing may be organized into, or provide, actionable information. Actionable information may be composed of any number, including none, of bits and/or bytes. The inclusion of bit 0 and byte 0 in FIG. 1 illustrates that it is possible that there are no bits and/or bytes in a particular embodiment. That is, it is possible that the information itself is a byte or that a bit is actionable information, that the information itself is actionable and the like.
By analogy to the bits and bytes of FIG. 1, a life bit may be a bit of data for a trait or aspect at a point in time. A life byte may be a collection of life bits. In an embodiment, the bits may be values of certain parameters, with bits of certain types (such as derived from certain data sources, including the ones described herein) being arranged in a predetermined way to form a byte. The byte may be an aggregate of the bits, which may for example, correspond to a particular type of information, such as a type of file, a message, a command, or the like, in the same way that a particular type of life byte may correspond to a particular type of information collected about a human state. The bytes may be sequenced or otherwise combined to form actionable information, such that a higher level system, such as an operating system, application, program, service or the like can take a byte or series of bytes and perform an operation based on the nature of the byte or sequence of bytes and in particular the bits that populate that byte.
Referring to FIG. 2, the concept of a lifeotype may be further understood by analogy to genetics. Genetic information may be organized in base pairs or genetic sequences and in their totality comprise the genotype. Life bits can be thought of as analogous to genes, which are organized according to the sequence of the genotype, but may or may not be expressed in a given individual, or may be expressed to a different extent in a particular individual. Particular genes or sequences of genes that are expressed (including, in some cases, expressed to a particular extent) and that, taken together, are of interest, may be assembled into genotypes, in the same way that life bytes or sequences of life bytes that are of interest may be assembled into lifeotypes. The genotypes in turn, through the interaction with the environment in some cases, may present as an overall phenotype, analogous to actionable information. As with FIG. 1, the inclusion of the subscript zeros in FIG. 2 indicates that a particular level of the hierarchy may be absent in certain embodiments.
 FIG. 3 depicts the organization structure of FIGS. 1 and 2 applied to lifeotypes. Referring to FIG. 3, the information or genetic sequences may be data, such as any of the data described herein, from any of the sources described herein. The data may be combined, used or accessed to create life bits. The life bits may be combined, used or accessed to create life bytes. A grouping or sequence of lifebytes may form a lifebyte sequence. Lifebytes and/or one or more lifebyte sequences may comprise or be organized into lifeotypes. The amount of information, number of life bits and/or number of life bytes included in a lifeotype may be determined based on many factors, such as user selection or the number of data points required to obtain uniqueness. As in FIGS. 1 and 2, the inclusion of the subscript zeros indicates that a particular level of the hierarchy may be absent in certain embodiments.
The entire range of data collected about an individual may be analogous to the entire genotype of an individual, and particular combinations in the data patterns may be analogous to genes or collections of genes that code for particular traits. As with a particular genotype, a particular lifeotype may code for or represent a particular set of traits. A lifeotype may change over time, including reasons such random change reasons due to therapy, such as behavior modification therapy, reasons due to other changes in an individual's behavior, how the individual interacts with his environment and vice-verse, and due to modifications, or additions to the amount and type of information being collected about an individual. This process may be analogous to gene mutations and gene therapy in genetics. Regarding therapeutics, the therapeutics process may be intentional or non-intentional and/or prescribed or self-administered. The pool of data may be less than the total pool of data, which may be analogous to sequencing less than all of the genetic code of an individual in genetics. Referring again to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, it may be possible to move in both directions in the hierarchies depicted in the figures. For example, in FIG. 3, the data or life bits may be determined from a life byte or lifeotype. In FIG. 1, it may be possible to work from actionable information back to information.
In an embodiment, a life bit may be body positional data, such as sitting or standing. A related life byte may be standing more than sitting. This life byte may contribute to the determination of a lifeotype which may be characterized as one relating to the condition of varicose veins. In another embodiment, the data may include financial and transaction data. The related life bits may include certain transactions and financial data. These life bits may be aggregated into a financial status life byte.
In another embodiment, a particular lifeotype may be that of a depressive. The data on which this lifeotype is based may include survey data, financial data, transaction data, medical data and sensor data. Sensors, such as the type described in United States patent applications incorporated herein by reference provide sensed data from which a derivation could be made regarding an individual's activity level, food intake, mood, and interaction with others. All of such sensed data in each patent application incorporated herein by reference is relevant to this and all other embodiments described herein. A relevant life bit may be composed of credit card purchases, and a relevant life byte may reveal that the majority of purchases were online and few were at point of sale terminals, thus revealing that the individual tends to stay in one location. The survey data may result in a life byte that indicates the individual is depressed. The sensor data may show that the individual spends most of his time in one location due to low levels of activity, and that the individual has limited interaction with others. These factors together may be a lifeotype or marker for a depression, analogous to a genetic marker or the genotype of an individual that is depressed.
In another embodiment, a lifeotype may be a hypertensive, diabetic runner. The data on which this lifeotype is based may include survey data, medical data and sensor data. Certain of the relevant life bytes may include age related information, bone density related information and a diabetic life byte. The values of these life bytes may indicate a high likelihood of hypertension and low bone density. The Platform may suggest additional data that should be collected for further investigation. A sensor may provide many activity life bits, which may indicate an overall active life byte. The Platform may sequence the life bytes to find the lifeotype to be a runner with low bone density, hypertension and diabetes.
In another embodiment, a particular lifeotype may be that of an active diabetic. This lifeotype may be a 4 byte lifeotype, where life byte 1 is a glucose reading, life byte 2 is a pancreas function measurement of some kind, life byte 3 is total calories consumed in a day and life byte 4 is total calories burned in exercise. Each byte may be composed of several life bits. In an embodiment, total calories burned may be determined from life bits including activity level data as determined by sensor data and food intake data as determined from a survey or any of the systems, devices or methods described in the patent application which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain of the life bytes may originate directly from the data, such as glucose readings determined directly from a glucose meter. The resulting life bits and life bytes may be packaged into their own data structures, such as a packet header
In an embodiment, a lifeotype may be a pattern of behavior and sensed values that indicates that an individual is at a very high risk of becoming diabetic later in life. In an embodiment, the lifeotype may be defined by four lifebytes. The first life byte may be composed of sensed health data life bits such as yearly blood pressure readings administered at a doctor's office and extracted from the individual's electronic medical record or personal health record. The second life byte may be residence data revealing that the individual lives in an urban area that is not conducive to year-round exercise and that is characterized by very long commute times. The third life byte may consist of data from a medical record and may indicate that the individual is Mexican-American and that two of the individual's four grandparents were diabetic before they died. The fourth life byte may consist of survey data and may indicate that the individual exercises very vigorously, but only occasionally with a frequency of 1.2 times per week and only for average of 75 minutes each time. In an alternative embodiment, a life byte may be that an individual is at a very high risk of becoming diabetic later in life and the life bits may be sensed health data, residence data, medical record data and survey data. In another embodiment, the lifeotype may be related to diabetes, hemorrhagic shock or hypertension. The data bits may related to genetic markers, diagnoses, plans for therapy, sensed data regarding physical activity, such as from a wearable device, energy expenditure, nutritional data and the like.
A genotype may be conceived of as an encoding of what may happen to a person through the process of developmental biology, similar to a blueprint for a house. This genetic blueprint may also be thought of as the gold-standard for the house, the platonic house, or the default house, based on all of which variation will occur. The genotype may also set the basic rules for how that physical body will function in response to particular kinds of changes to that body. By analogy, this may be like the house having a built in furnace and thermostat and being set to turn on the heat when the thermostat drops below a particular temperature.
A genotype may have various levels of abstractions that are useful to understand about the way that encoding (that blueprint) is translated into a physical system or the basic rules of operation of that physical system. A genotype in a human is made up of atoms, but that is often too fine grained a level of detail and is not usually considered a useful way to talk about the genotype. The lowest level of abstraction normally used for a genotype are the base pairs that make it up (âA T C and Gâ).
The state of your body at some point in the future may not entirely be determined by its genetic make up. Genetics may have, over time, only a minority impact on the state of a person's body. The other relevant elements may be the things that happen to a body. A simple illustrative example is as follows: if a car side-swipes a person and breaks the person's leg, the body has changed dramatically and not because of genetics (although genetics may affect the extent of the break, the time to heal and the like). Similarly, if a person eats too much over a long period of time and becomes obese, this was not a fact solely related to the person's blue print (genotype) but of the complex web of cause and effect interactions that the person has with the world as the person lives his life (although genetics may affect that person's interaction with the world, such as by determining at least in part the effects that food has on the person's body). In one particular embodiment, this data collected about a person that corresponds to the series of things that happens to a person or because of a person's choices which determines to a large extent what will happen to a person in the future can be thought of as a lifeotype. In certain embodiments, a lifeotype may also include or be based on genetics-related information (as bits, bytes, life byte sequences, etc.), as well as any of the other information discussed herein.
Referring to FIGS. 24A-24B, in one particular embodiment, like the human genotype, the human lifeotype may have various levels of abstraction. In this particular embodiment, at the lowest level (the equivalent to the base pairs), are all the facts of what happened to a person expressed in their raw âsensedâ values. An example is as follows: each key stroke that a person made at his/her computer, each acceleration a person's body experiences as it moves about daily life, a person's heart rate at each minute of the day, and the like. In this particular embodiment, the equivalent to the alleles and their relative importance (intron vs. extron) may be the notion of a continuum from âderived dataâ through âpatterns of data.â So for example, thinking about many of the sensed values about a person's body not in isolation but taken together in a model of energy expended may be a âderivedâ lifeotype fact in this particular embodiment. In this particular embodiment, at a higher level of derivation or pattern finding might be that over a period of time energy expenditure is high enough to qualify as an âactive person.â And, in this particular embodiment, up at the level, by analogy, of a chromosome for a lifeotype may be the notion of the implication of major patterns of the data of your life upon the future state of your body. For example, being an active person makes obesity, diabetes, depression, and heart disease all some what less likely to occur to you. In this particular embodiment, just like gene therapy is an attempt to improve a person's body in the future by changing some of the genetic blue print, an individual could also receive a suggested change to his lifeotype that would tend to improve his body's future state as well. For example, âa person may not be an active person and if he was to exercise an additional 60 minutes per week, raising him into the state of being an active person, he is less likely to develop the following diseases within the next two decades . . . .â This type of suggested action may be an action type, or A-type. FIG. 25 depicts a particular embodiment of a statistical model involving lifeotypes. In this embodiment, conditional probabilities may be determined based on lifeotypes. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the analogies described herein are for illustrative purposes and should not serve to limit the meaning of terms described herein. None of the usages of the terms in the analogies or examples herein are intended to contradict the meaning of any term in this disclosure, but rather as alternate meanings or nuanced meanings of the terms.
Referring to FIG. 4, the data may include continuous or discrete data or any form of data that may be found along this spectrum. In an embodiment, the data may be continuous temperature data and/or a discrete measure such as a voltage. The data may include raw or derived data or any form of data that may be found along this spectrum. The raw data may be unprocessed. The derived data may be derived from the raw data, other derived data or a combination of both. The data may be sensed by a body monitor and/or a sensor, which may be stationary, wearable or implantable, or any form that may be found along this spectrum. A stationary sensor may be housed in an item of fitness equipment, such as a treadmill. A wearable sensor may be included as part of an arm band, shirt or shoe. In an embodiment, an implantable sensor may be a heart rate sensor implanted near the heart. Referring to FIG. 5, a lifeotype may or may not be constructed from at least one item of discrete or continuous data, raw or derived data and/or data sensed by a body monitor and/or sensor which may be stationary, wearable or implantable. The inclusion of the subscript zeros in FIG. 5 indicates that a particular level of the hierarchy may be absent in certain embodiments.
A lifeotype may be static or dynamic or may exist in a form found along this spectrum. That is, a lifeotype may consist of data that is more static over time or data that is more dynamic over time. A lifeotype may be high resolution or low resolution or may exist in a form along this spectrum. That is, a lifeotype may consist of a variety of life bytes, life bits and data, which would make it a lifeotype of a higher resolution when compared to a lifeotype that is based on relatively few life bytes, life bits and data instances. A static lifeotype and a high resolution lifeotype may respond in similar ways to changes in the data on which each is based. This behavior similarity may be due to a greater number and variety of life bytes, life bits and data instances being involved, so it requires a greater change in the underlying factors and data to produce a change at the lifeotype level. A dynamic lifeotype and a low resolution lifeotype may respond in similar ways to changes in the data on which each is based. This behavior similarity may be due to a lower number and low variety of life bytes, life bits and data instances being involved, so it requires only a change in one or a few values of the underlying factors and data to produce a change at the lifeotype level. In embodiments, a low resolution and/or dynamic lifeotypes, or the life byte sequences, life bytes, life bits and/or data upon which they are based, may include angry, aroused, tired, fatigued, current spending, location, restless, stressed and the like. In embodiments, a high resolution and/or static lifeotypes, or the life byte sequences, life bytes, life bits and/or data upon which they are based, may include depressed, addict, diabetic (type I and II), insomniac, cardiac condition and the like. In certain embodiments a high resolution lifeotype may change rapidly over time and a low resolution lifeotype may change more slowly over time. Lifeotypes can be true or representative at specific points or ranges of time in a person's life. Lifeotypes may reflect different time scales.
The Platform may be able to determine and/or display the direction of a lifeotype. In this way, the direction of trend of a lifeotype and/or group of lifeotypes can be determined. This information may be useful for identifying and/or predicting changes in high resolution and/or static lifeotypes. In an embodiment, due to the possibly variable nature of a low resolution and/or dynamic lifeotypes, such lifeotypes may be conceived of or reported with a tolerance band based on related trend information and predictions. In another embodiment, the trend information and predictions may be useful in predicting emergencies in connection with low resolution and/or dynamic lifeotypes and disease states in connection with high resolution and/or static lifeotypes. Lifeotype trend information, including trend directions, may be useful for treating certain conditions for which certain parameters need to be kept in a certain range. In an embodiment, certain lifeotypes of bipolar individuals may need to be kept within a certain range for a certain parameter, such as mood or endorphin levels. Using the trend direction functionality it may be possible to affect the trend as the lifeotype value approaches the boundary of the range.

The data may also include changes in cardiac output or other body conditions when individuals are moved up or down the waiting list for a new heart. The data may include information regarding which individuals died before a heart was ready for them and the details of each death. This data may relate to life bit and life byte information (such as EE) to find a life byte that changes in a way that will allow for sorting of individuals on the heart transplant waiting list to minimize deaths of people on the list and to maximize the chances of survival after the operation, or other metrics of success.
In an embodiment, the data may include data relating to, or the platform may analyze a subpopulation composed of, a group of individuals that have some known and unusual outcome, conditions or situation. For example, the condition may be a rare mental disease, such as a split personality. The platform may enable identification of one or more life bytes that cluster this group; that is, separate them from the rest of the population. In an embodiment, the group may be individuals with MS and the life byte may be subtle but measurable changes in their activity lengths and patterns relative to their norms in the year just before they are diagnosed with MS.
In an embodiment, the platform may allow for identification of a group of individuals that have some known and unusual life byte. The platform may then be used to, or may itself, look for what outcomes or situations each individual shares with others from this group. For example, the platform may find that 0.1% of the population exercises more than 4 hours a day every week and yet never exercises more than 1 day a week. The platform may identify characteristics that the people with that lifebyte have in common. For example, the platform may identify that they all die before 60 years of age.
The platform may be used to conduct event studies and experiments. In an embodiment, the platform may be used to identify a group of individuals that have a certain outcome or characteristic, such as, for example, high stress. The platform may also be used to identify certain other events or interventions that happened to certain subgroups of the group of individuals. In this way that effects of the events or interventions can be studied. As a result, the database can be used to determine the effects of the intervention on the group of people, without additional experimentation. The platform may allow a user to form a hypothesis and then examine or watch related groups of individuals in the database to confirm or reject the hypothesis. The hypothesis may be modified over time based on changes in the data, such as the subsequent effects of the events and interventions of interest. The hypothesis may be reinforced, broken down and rebuilt. This may be an iterative process.
The platform may be used for predictions. In an embodiment, a user may describe or input their life bits, life bytes and other relevant information and the platform may determine lifeotypes or predict health, wealth, happiness outcomes and the like. The predictions may be based on information for individuals with similar life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and related information. In another embodiment, the platform may allow a user to explore the effects of certain changes on lifeotypes and outcomes. For example, the platform may allow a user to answer the following question: if I changed my life bytes in this way, what should I expect in terms of changed health, wealth, happiness and the like?
The platform may enable maximization along certain dimensions. Referring to FIGS. 26A-26B, in an embodiment, the platform may allow a user to âhill climbâ to the local maximum that seems like a reasonable set of changed life bytes for a particular person such that it will maximize her health, wealth, happiness and the like. The user may be able to assign various weights to the various outcomes to indicate their relative importance to her. The platform may base the optimization, at least in part, on data relating to other individuals, such as what is a reasonable set of suggestible life byte changes for this person based on other similar people and whether or not similar people have been able to change their lifeotypes in this way.
The platform may allow for comparisons. In an embodiment, the platform may allow users to compare their life bit, life byte, lifeotype and other information and outcomes to other individuals or groups of individuals, such as similar individuals or groups of similar individuals.

The interface may show life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information for a particular population or the entire world in a visually appealing and explorable way. In an embodiment, the platform may superimpose life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information over a 3D globe so that a user can see where people are awake, asleep, active, sedentary, stressed, calm and the like.
The platform and life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used for financial analysis and/or to predict information that is monetizable. In an embodiment, the platform, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to predict changes in the stock market, or particular securities or groups of securities, based on changes in life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. In an embodiment, the life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be from around the country or a particular region. In an embodiment, the platform may aggregate the life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information into indexes, such as a âpeople are getting sadder/pessimisticâ and a âpeople are getting happier/optimisticâ index. The platform may then use those indexes or indicators to predict near term and long term trends in the overall market, or a subset of the market. In another embodiment, the platform may enable prediction of individual stock trends from specific changes in life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. For example, if people start jogging more, it may be advisable to stock in running shoe companies, such as Nike. If people start walking more it may be advisable to buy more stock in Weight Watchers. In another embodiment, the platform, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to predict information relating to sporting events.

The platform may be used for epidemiology applications. In an embodiment, the platform, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to predict the onset of a flu outbreak in a city 12 to 24 hours before it is otherwise seen by watching for subtle shifting patterns in life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information, such as higher estimated core temperature or lower activity, adjusting for other relevant factors such as location, time of day, weather patterns and the like. In another embodiment, the platform may be used to identify patterns of behaviors, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information that lead to a certain outcome, such as a positive outcome. For example, sleeping 9 hours per night and exercising every day before noon may result in weight loss. In an embodiment, this information may be used to create a service business.
The platform may be used for data business applications. In an embodiment, access to life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be sold or licensed. In an embodiment life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be sold. In an embodiment, a particular aggregate view of certain life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be sold to academics for the purpose of conducting outcome studies. This may allow the studies to be performed on a much shorter time scale of a few minutes as opposed to several years. The platform may also allow for identification of groups of interest. In an embodiment, the platform may allow for identification of individuals with certain life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information of interest. The platform may enable a user to contact those people to seek additional information. In embodiments, the people may be paid or given other consideration to provide the missing or additional information. In an embodiment, the platform may allow a user to identify a group of people who take a particular pill, are of a particular ethnicity, and have a particular stress level. The user may want to know the fasting glucose level of these people, but that data is not available. The platform may enable the user to, directly or indirectly, contact all or a portion of these people, or one or more of their representatives, to obtain the fasting glucose level information. The people or their representatives may be paid for the information. The newly obtained information may then be used in other applications.
The platform may be used for planning applications. In an embodiment, the platform may be used to automate budgeting and city planning. In an embodiment, instead of giving each state and city money based on how much the state or the American Automobile Association says the roads are utilized, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to make the determination. The determination may be made on a periodic basis, such as quarterly or annually, and the budget adjusted. The platform may be used for similar applications in the healthcare field. In an embodiment, the platform may utilize behavioral census information in connection with the determinations.
The platform may be used for social and social networking applications. In an embodiment, referring to FIG. 27A-27B, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used for match making A dating website or company may match people based on life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. For example, a person who goes to bed at 8 pm and wakes at 5 am is likely not to be compatible with someone who goes to be at 2 am regularly. In another embodiment, referring to FIGS. 28A-28B, the platform may determine a user's probability of locating a person with a particular lifeotype or range of lifeotypes in a particular location, such as a particular bar, neighborhood, city or country. For example, a dating website or business may use the platform, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information to assess whether a particular city has compatible lifeotypes for a particular person and if so in what quantities. This determination may be used to informing vacationing and relocation decisions. For example, the person may want to vacation in an area in which she has a high chance of meeting someone with a compatible lifeotype.
In an embodiment, a healthcare professional may summarize, or provide information, including life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information, relating to, the types of patients she typically sees or the types of patients she is good at seeing. This information may be aggregated with information obtained from patients, such as ratings, reviews, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. The platform may enable a user, such as a patient, to choose a healthcare provider based on this information. In an embodiment, the platform may allow a patient to choose or recommend to a patient a certain healthcare provider that is good at treating people with the same lifeotype as the patient. The healthcare provider may be any of the healthcare providers described herein, including a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist, weight management specialist and the like. The healthcare professional may also be a more general service provider such as a personal trainer, yoga instructor or the like. In another embodiment, the healthcare professional may be a an institution or organization, such as a hospital, university, health maintenance organization, dentist office and the like.
In certain embodiments, the platform may enable the study of how certain life bits, life bytes and other information impact and/or effect the evolution of lifeotypes. This information may be used to impact or affect lifeotypes. In an embodiment, the impact of a particular television show on a group of lifeotypes over time may be studied. Watching the television show may form a segment of life byte information. The show may be a program about weight loss, such as a contest to lose weight named âThe Biggest Loser.â It may be determined that watching the program aids individuals who are between 10 and 45 pounds overweight with weight loss. It may also be determined that watching the program frustrates people who are more than 60 pounds overweight. This information may be used to affect the relevant life bytes and lifeotypes by showing the program or similar programs to certain groups of people, determined based on life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. The process may be consensual, with each person consenting to participation in the program.
In an embodiment, the relationship between life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information and teaching and learning may be determined. Life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information along with the relationships to teaching and learning may be used to separate students into groups subject to different teaching techniques to alter the efficacy of the teaching. In an embodiment, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to alter or optimize a method, system, process, work flow, organizational structure, structure, organization and the like. Life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information collected from different people involved in or at different points in the method, system, process, work flow, organizational structure, structure, organization and the like may be used to alter or optimize the method, system, process, work flow, organizational structure, structure, organization and the like. In an embodiment, elderly people and the staff at an assisted living facility may be wearing body monitors. Using the monitors it may be possible to determine when an elderly person soils his or her diaper and this information may be collected and aggregates across all of the elderly people. Using the monitors, or by other means, it may be possible to determine the frequency with which the staff changes the soiled diapers. For example, it may be determined that the staff make rounds to change diapers twice per day. The two patterns may be brought together to assess the typical delay between soiling and changing of a diaper and possibly improve the situation by altering the pattern and reducing the delay.
In an embodiment, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to tailor the delivery of advertising. For example, a person with a physically fit lifeotype that spends time biking, may have bicycle ads focused at them. In another example, if two women always go walking together they may be good candidates for a women's only gym, such as Curves. In an embodiment, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used for career counseling. Life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be collected in relation to various jobs and careers. Information concerning the satisfaction, ability, performance, happiness and the like of people in certain professions may be collected and linked to life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information. This information may be used to generate norms or profiles of certain profession and lifeotypes pairs or groupings which may be used for career counseling. In an embodiment, the platform may allow a user to determine which job she should accept in order to maximize her happiness and productivity.
In embodiments, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to model or study transmission of certain diseases and conditions. In an particular embodiment, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information from many people in a particular area may be used to build more detailed models of the transmission of particular disease or condition whose onset is detectable in the life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information of the people. The disease or condition may be a cold, flu, infection or the like.
In embodiments, lifeotype information may be used for recruiting. In an embodiment, a company may determine use life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information to determine that people with certain lifeotypes function better at the company and may use this information to inform hiring decisions. In embodiments, a company may use life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information to build models of the kinds of lifeotypes that seem to drive retention and success at work in order to try to promote those lifeotypes in the company. For example, if it turns out that people who sleep more than 8 hours per day tend not to ever be promoted at a particular company, but those who sleep less than 6 hours per night tend to burn out and quit, and those who fall in the middle stay at the company 90% of the time from year to year and the promotion rate is 35% from year to year, then the company may suggest or require time in bed to be changed from 7 to 9 hours to 6 to 8 hours. In embodiments, life bits, life bytes, lifeotypes and/or related information may be used to monitor and affect morale in a workplace, school, military environment, prison or the like.
Referring to FIGS. 14 through 17, lifeotypes may be identified and analyzed in a variety of ways. The Platform may identify, generate and create lifeotypes. The analysis layer may identify, generate and create lifeotypes. The following techniques may be used to identify and analyze lifeotypes: iterative optimization, genetic programming, stochastic simulations, model generation and model use (including dynamic probabilistic networks), simulated annealing, Markov methods, reinforcement learning, partial programming, stochastic beam search, model based search, goal-based search, goal-based methods, feedback loops and artificial intelligence. The Platform and/or analysis layer may learn. The Platform and/or the analysis layer may determine the number of life bits and life bytes to include in a lifeotype. This determination may be based on many factors, such as user selection, optimization of data processing or the number of traits required to obtain uniqueness. Feedback loops may identify additional life bits and life bytes, or recommendations for new life bits and life bytes to seek data in connection with. The processes involved may be dynamic.
Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying parameters that may be sensed. This may largely be determined by what is available. Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying parameters that may be derived. This will be determined at least in part by what is useful for other applications. Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying patterns in the derived data. In an embodiment, the pattern may be many nights of low sleep as a pattern of âprolonged sleep deprivation.â In an embodiment, the pattern may be many exercise events per week being called an âactive person.â In an embodiment, the pattern may be more than 4 hours of exercise per day being identified as an âexercise bulimic.â In an embodiment, the steps for identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying what is it about the world that is desired to be understood or predicted. For example, information concerning prolonged sleep deprivation. The next step may be determining if there are patterns in the derived data that can be discovered through human intervention and description, automatic discovery by a computer or both. The relationship of the patterns in the derived data to the topic to be understood may then be assessed. If there is a strong relationship the analysis may be sufficient. If there is not a strong relationship, the analysis may involve determining if there are new derivable parameters that would be of assistance. If the data is available these parameters may be added and the steps repeated. If this data is not available it may be requested or surrogates may be identified. If this can not be done or the raw data is not available, then the question may be asked âwhat could be added to the raw data pool (i.e. what new parameters could be directly sensed or calculated or gathered in some way) such that the analysis can be performed? If such a set of new raw values in would help and could be gathered then either add them or do what it takes (i.e. adding the sensors to new body monitors) so that at some point in the future the data will have these new values and the process can be repeated.
In an embodiment, lifeotypes may be created, identified, discovered and the like by a lifeotype discovery module. The lifeotype discovery module may utilize a novelty detector, for example, in the domain where physiological data is collected and a large body of such data exists for many individuals. Any variable that, for some subset of individuals, is statistically outside the norms for the population could be of interest. In an embodiment, for a large dataset, an infinite number of features may be defined of varying complexity. This continuum can be thought of as starting with single variable reports about an individual (e.g. their average daily physical activity is low) to relative measures (e.g. their average daily physical activity is low for their age) to complex pattern based interactions (e.g. their daily physical activity after a night of poor sleep is high for their age). The Platform may determine which lifeotypes have utility. In one embodiment, the lifeotypes selected may be those that have some predictive power with respect to other lifeotypes, as determined by an analysis module.
In an embodiment, feature discovery may proceed by starting with the simplest single variable features (e.g. total values per day of sleep, energy expenditure, or physical activity and the like) and examining whether statistically significant relationships exist to other measures of interest (e.g. health outcomes, disease states, weight loss, stress level, and the like). The user may set up these different classes of lifeotypes (e.g. input and output) or the Platform may try all pairs. In this example, only features that are sufficiently strongly correlated would become true or saved lifeotypes. Another embodiment would utilize a random walk across pattern space (instead of using an ordered list), utilizing techniques from the stochastic beam search literature, evolutionary computation, simulated annealing, Markov Chain, Monte Carlo and the like. The invention machine, in one embodiment, can be constantly searching over the database to find relationships between patterns and outcomes that exceed a given statistical level. A related embodiment allows the human users of the system to âprimeâ certain patterns to be tested for first and/or serve as starting points for the search.
The Platform, analysis layer, sensors, systems and methods may be calibrated, such as by using algorithm to improve another. In an embodiment, a GSR measurement can be used to more correctly interpret a heart rate measurement. As a result, even in the absence of the GSR measurement, based on the past GSR data, a more accurate heart rate measurement may be obtained. This process may also allow for calibration of slow changes in a user over time. For example, a user may wear more clothing in the winter than in the summer. Calibration may be done through the use of a training pack and/or calibration pack. The training and/or calibration pack may be a component of an item of fitness equipment. In an embodiment, the training pack may contain sensors which may measure heart rate. The data collected by the heart rate sensors may be used to calibrate the algorithm used to determine energy expenditure from other sensors. The heart rate sensors may be more sensitive and a correction algorithm may update or calibrate the determination of energy expenditure. In an embodiment, a location pack may provide location and other contextual information, such as, in the car, in the wearer's home gym, and the like. The location and contextual data can be used to calibrate the determination of energy expenditure. Contextual data may also be used to inform or adjust measurements and/or algorithms. A marker may be used for calibration.
The Platform and/or analysis layer may analyze and process lifeotypes and related data. The Platform and/or analysis layer may identify lifeotype patterns and/or correlations across different populations, sub-populations, groups or sub-groups or across different lifeotypes, life bits and life bytes. The correlations may be overtime. The Platform and/or analysis layer may classify a population by sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, culture, age, conditions, geographic region, medical conditions, activity levels, participants in a certain game or sport and the like. The Platform and/or analysis layer may identify relevant lifeotypes, life bits, life bytes, parameters, other data and the like. In an embodiment, the Platform and/or analysis layer may identify sub-populations in disparate sections of the world which share certain lifeotypes. For example, people in Helsinki and those in a mountain valley region in California may share certain lifeotypes, life bits and life bytes as they both live in a cloudy climate.
The Platform and/or analysis layer may identify pattern-inference pairs or groups. In an embodiment, the Platform and/or analysis layer may identify that a person who does X dies within Y or a person who does activity V is likely to contract condition W. The pattern-interference pairs may take into account time and/or geography. The Platform may allow for predictions of the future or identification and extension of trends. The Platform may allow a user to determine how making a change in the past would affect a current situation. The Platform and/or analysis layer may allow for self-testing. Platform and/or analysis layer may predict future outcomes for an individual and show likely default outcomes given current lifeotype expression. The Platform and/or analysis layer may allow what-if testing. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize probabilities in the prediction of the future. For example, stopping smoking decreases chances of throat cancer and increases the chances of short-term stress.
The Platform and/or analysis layer may generate many correlations, conclusions, results, pairs and the like and create a database of them which may be analyzed by the Platform and/or the analysis layer. The Platform and/or analysis layer may publish reports and suggest future studies. Platform and/or analysis layer may make recommendations. The Platform and/or analysis layer may generate treatment programs. The Platform and/or analysis layer may generate sub-populations or sub-groups for certain purposes. The Platform and/or analysis layer may derive data. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize iterative optimization. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize genetic programming. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize feedback loops. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize cycling back. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize artificial intelligence. The Platform and/or analysis layer may actively search for more information. The Platform and/or analysis layer may make requests of its users. In an embodiment the Platform and/or analysis layer may ask a user to provide three more blood samples.
The Platform and/or analysis layer may be mined as an invention machine. The Platform and/or analysis layer may utilize the concepts of an invention machine, such as by being a goal-driven iterative engine searching for solutions. The Platform and/or analysis layer may identify trends in lifeotypes and in information accessed or provided to users. The Platform and/or analysis layer may use a loop to identify additional life bits and life bytes, or recommendations for new life bits and life bytes to seek data in connection with. The Platform and/or analysis layer may discover new life bits, life bytes, derived data, surrogates and the like. The Platform and/or analysis layer may be used for predicting. In an embodiment the Platform and/or analysis layer may be used to predict the success of research programs, success of projects, success of business initiatives, future disease states, stocks to buy and the like. The Platform and/or analysis layer may be used for guided information gathering. Further, the Platform will reveal new types of information that allow for the creation of particular assessment times and protocols. For instance, it may be determined that viewing the continuous sensed data of an individual for 15 minutes upon waking will give insight into whether that person is at risk for heart disease. In this way, the Platform can make specific predictions about individuals from specific sources and types of data, which the Platform itself has determined to be optimal.
In an embodiment, the analysis may include identifying high value lifeotypes. The Platform may examine a library of lifeotypes as a model of the world with probabilistic outcomes and perform behavior learning using any of a number of techniques to produce an optimal strategy to obtain a desired outcome. As an example, for a particular individual (say, a 35-year old smoker who also exercises vigorously three times a week and eats poorly), the system may analyze the\particular lifeotype and determine that the most useful (and likely to be successful) strategy would be to cut back on smoking by 50% and eat better, rather than quitting smoking entirely. The system may determine this by considering many different action-strategies, using the stored data to simulate the effects, and searching over the action space to find an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning and the class of program search strategies may also allow the solution of this behavior optimization strategy.
Lifeotypes may be based on relative measures. There may be relative lifeotypes, relative life bytes and relative life bits. Changes from a baseline or norm may be recorded in connection with a relative lifeotype, relative life byte and/or relative life bit.
